# i

**i** is a program to instantly pull your **public** IP address circumventing the hassle to google such for when it is needed.

# Use Cases:
    * To see if your VPN truly is working.
    * To quickly view while developing software that may need an IP address for testing.
    * Not quite a use case but instead of searching through ifconfig output and such it is just nice to plainly have it accessible right through the terminal.
